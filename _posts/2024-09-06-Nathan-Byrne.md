**Nathan Byrne** has been periodically making work which is informed by and responds to the enigmatic and rather quirky German-Swiss modernist writer Robert Walser for half a decade now. This exhibition zeros in on a book by Walser titled *The Robber* which was never published during his lifetime and is the only extant novel of his written entirely in his signature “microscript” (tiny writing in pencil) on 24 octavo-sized sheets of paper. In this novel, “The Robber” is the alter-ego of Walser and a character through which Walser explores strange scenarios he never felt comfortable enacting in his own life.
In this body of work “The Robber” becomes an alter-ego of Byrne as well and the artwork volleys between the artist’s obsession with both Robert Walser and “The Robber” which is “worked through” at times exhaustively (through transcription of text) and other times spontaneously (through sculpture).
